        <P>
          Without a standing grant, a gated action inserts a pending-approval row and returns{' '}
          <Strong>not executed</Strong> until the dashboard approves it. Approvals persist per action
          signature, so retrying after approval succeeds, and a decision taken while the app is closed
          applies next boot. Internal agents (system, extraction, skill-improvement, MCP sessions) get
          justified standing grants; user rules get none.
        </P>

        <H2>One capability model, two lanes</H2>
        <P>
          A capability declaration is the single source of truth for both sandbox lanes and the kernel
          gates. Empty arrays and zero spend mean deny.
        </P>
        <CodeBlock
          label="CapabilityDeclaration"
          code={`{ fsRead: string[], fsWrite: string[], netDomains: string[],
  tools: string[], maxSpendUSD: number }

// Deno lane   → --no-prompt --no-remote plus --allow-read/write/net
//               only for the declared paths and domains.
// Docker lane → --network none --cap-drop ALL --read-only --user uid:gid,
//               scoped :ro / :rw mounts. A declaration with netDomains
//               THROWS: plain docker run cannot enforce per-domain egress,
//               so network-capable rules belong in the Deno lane.`}

        <P>
          Both lanes share one contract: the program gets one JSON document on stdin and must print
          one JSON document to stdout. Anything else is a structured error. Output is bounded to 1 MiB
          and a wall-clock deadline is enforced with SIGKILL.
        </P>

        <H2>Audit log and working undo</H2>
        <P>
          Every committed action logs a reversible delta, captured <Strong>before</Strong> it runs: a
          created node&apos;s inverse is a delete, an updated node&apos;s inverse is the pre-image of
          only the touched properties, a file write&apos;s inverse is the backed-up original. Raw
          mutating Cypher has no generic inverse, so the whole action is flagged irreversible rather
          than half-undone. Undo applies the inverse through the same write lane and is itself audited.
        </P>
        <Callout tone="accent" title="Undo by source">
          Because provenance is stamped on everything, one query can purge everything extracted from a
          poisoned session.
        </Callout>

        <H2>Untrusted content and the injection scanner</H2>
        <P>
          Ingested and tool content is typed as <Code>UntrustedText</Code>, which is deliberately not
          assignable to <Code>string</Code>. It can only reach storage or a prompt through two named
          sink functions, and its coercion traps return a redacted marker so accidental interpolation
          leaks nothing.
        </P>
        <P>
          At ingest, an injection scanner runs a deterministic regex pass and an optional local-LLM
          verdict. A flag <Strong>never blocks ingestion</Strong>. Content stores as inert data
          regardless, and the finding lands in the review queue. Detection is the fallible layer;
          containment and undo are the reliable ones.
        </P>

        <H3>The $0.50 budget ceiling</H3>
        <P>
          Every cloud-touching agent checks the per-task ceiling <Strong>before</Strong> spending and
          records cost after, so a runaway loop halts on the first call past the ceiling. The spend
          tier is also pre-checked at the permission layer, giving two independent enforcement points.

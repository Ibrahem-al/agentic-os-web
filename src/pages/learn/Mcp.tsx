Claude Code, or any MCP client, connects over loopback HTTP with a bearer token and calls one of ~38 tools — reads, staged-write proposals, and control triggers.

        <P>
          The transport is <Strong>Streamable HTTP, not stdio</Strong>: the server lives inside the
          long-running Electron app, which MCP clients do not spawn. It binds loopback only.

        <H2>How a request is authenticated</H2>
        <P>
          Before any session routing, every request&apos;s bearer token is compared to the keychain
          token with a SHA-256 + <Code>timingSafeEqual</Code> check. A miss returns 401 with{' '}
          <Code>WWW-Authenticate: Bearer</Code> and is deliberately <Strong>not</Strong> logged to{' '}
          <Code>mcp_calls</Code>. The real token is never printed by default; the boot log shows only a{' '}
          <Code>&lt;token&gt;</Code> placeholder.
        </P>

        <H2>The chokepoint</H2>
        <P>
          The server uses the low-level SDK <Code>Server</Code>, not <Code>McpServer</Code>, precisely
          so a single <Code>CallTool</Code> handler covers every tool call including unknown names and
          invalid args. Logging happens in that handler&apos;s <Code>finally</Code>, so no code path
          can invoke a tool without leaving a row. Every call also runs inside{' '}
          <Code>kernel.execute(...)</Code>, which produces a span and applies the permission seam.

        <H2>The tool surface</H2>
        <P>
          The original v1 surface is the seven tools below. It has since grown to about 38 — read
          tools for every dashboard view, staged-write tools that drive the whole learning loop, and
          control tools that trigger sanctioned internal jobs — but the shape never changes:{' '}
          <Strong>reads open, writes land only as staged proposals, and the human-gated approve /
          reject / undo / grant decisions stay off the tool surface entirely.</Strong> zod schemas are
          the validators, and <Code>z.toJSONSchema()</Code> derives the advertised{' '}
          <Code>tools/list</Code> schema from the same definition, so validation and advertisement can
          never drift. The seven originals, most of them read-only:

          head={['tool', 'access', 'what it does']}
          rows={[
            ['get_context', 'read', 'Full hybrid retrieval + self-correcting loop. Returns a token-budgeted bundle with a confidence flag and always-included global preferences.'],

        <CodeBlock label="terminal" code={CLAUDE_MCP_ADD} />
        <P>
          A project-scope <Code>.mcp.json</Code> is also written into the app&apos;s data directory:

        <CodeBlock

        <H3>2. Sessions and correlation</H3>
        <P>
          The transport&apos;s <Code>mcp-session-id</Code> (a UUID) is the correlation key. It is also
          the kernel agent id (<Code>mcp:&lt;sessionId&gt;</Code>) and the staged-write proposer
          suffix, so a staged correction, its span, and its <Code>mcp_calls</Code> rows all trace back
          to one session. Multiple clients each get their own isolated transport and server.
        </P>
        <H3>3. Session end</H3>
        <P>
          A Claude Code <Code>SessionEnd</Code> hook POSTs to <Code>/hooks/session-end</Code> when a
          session finishes, which enqueues extraction. If the app is offline, the hook script spools
          the payload to <Code>~/.agentic-os/pending-sessions/</Code> and it drains on next launch. A
          30-minute MCP-inactivity sweep is the fallback for clients without the hook.
        </P>

        <H2>The app is also an MCP client</H2>
        <P>
          It can consume external MCP servers the user adds (HTTP or stdio), configured in{' '}
          <Code>mcp-servers.json</Code>. The config file never holds a token; an HTTP entry names a
          keychain secret that is resolved at connect time.

        <P>Three convergent triggers, deduped to exactly one extraction per session:</P>
        <Ul>
          <Li><Strong>The SessionEnd hook</Strong> POSTs the session id and transcript path to the app, which enqueues extraction.</Li>
          <Li><Strong>The spool drain</Strong> replays sessions that arrived while the app was closed.</Li>

      <DocProse>
        <Ul>
          <Li><Strong>collect</Strong> reads the server-side call log and parses the transcript.</Li>
          <Li><Strong>deterministic</Strong> plans the facts the OS controls at confidence 1.0: skills used, MCPs/plugins, the project by working directory, session timing. It matches existing nodes only, never inventing shells.</Li>
          <Li><Strong>extract</Strong> runs focused local-LLM passes (components, preferences, corrections) with constrained JSON decoding. A malformed item is dropped, never a crash; a missing confidence becomes 0.5.</Li>
          <Li><Strong>resolve</Strong> deduplicates against memory with a tiered ladder: stable-key, then cosine ≥ 0.90 merge, then an LLM tiebreak in the 0.75-0.90 band, then a new node.</Li>
          <Li><Strong>verify</Strong> sends below-gate items to an independent verifier that must be a different model than the extractor.</Li>
          <Li><Strong>write</Strong> commits or stages each item through one audited write-lane job.</Li>

          Items at or above 0.6 confidence commit. Below that, an item commits only if an independent
          verifier confirms it; otherwise it is <Strong>staged to the review queue</Strong> with a
          human-readable reason. Low-confidence memory never lands silently.

        <H3>Escalation</H3>
        <P>
          Two gates push a session to the optional cloud tier: a transcript over 60k tokens, or a
          local confidence below 0.6. Both fall back to the local result if no cloud key is
          configured. Every cloud call is metered against the task&apos;s $0.50 ceiling.

        <H2>Skill improvement: getting better overnight</H2>
        <P>
          At 02:00, or on a manual &quot;improve now,&quot; skills that accrued new corrections or
          failure examples get a candidate rewrite, benchmarked against the active version. It
          reimplements the skill-creator methodology in-process.

          <Li><Strong>plan</Strong> event-gates on new signal since the last run and scans for drift.</Li>
          <Li><Strong>testset</Strong> turns each correction into a regression case and pads with synthetic cases, then splits 60/40 into train and a held-out set the rewriter never sees.</Li>
          <Li><Strong>candidate</Strong> asks the cloud brain to rewrite the SKILL.md from recent failures. It sees the corrections, never the test cases.</Li>
          <Li><Strong>benchmark</Strong> runs candidate vs active on the LOCAL tier: an assertion grader for verifiable skills, a blind A/B comparator (judged by the cloud tier) for stylistic ones.</Li>

        <P>
          Every adoption is versioned (candidate → active, prior active → retired) and the skill
          re-embeds so retrieval serves the new version immediately. New versions are{' '}
          <Strong>drift-watched</Strong> over their first 20 uses; a worse corrections-per-use rate can
          flag or auto-revert. Every version flip is a reversible audited delta.
